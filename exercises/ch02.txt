Concepts:
1.a) n is large, p is small? Inflexible is better, reduces the error for max samples, will be more general for new samples.

1.b) N is small, p is very large? Very flexible to give the most wide possibility of accuracy

1c) non liner relationship? flexible given relationship

1d) Var(e) is high? Inflexible to give broad capture

2a) Regression, inference, n = 500, p = 3
2b) Classification, prediction, n= 20, p= 13
2c) Regression, prediction, n =52, p = 3
